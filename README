If you know about an ID which is not listed in the database, you are welcome to submit a new entry as a Pull Request.

After you submit the change, it will wait for approval by an admin.

Rules
There is a couple of simple rules you should obey:

* Avoid generic names like "unknown network card", they are not likely to help anybody.
* Prefer chip names over marketing names. If you know both, please include the marketing name in square brackets (e.g., "3c595 100BaseTX [Vortex]").
* Do not repeat the name of the vendor in the name of the device.
* Look at the names of similar devices and follow the same form.
* Verify the kind of the entry: do not submit subsystems as devices, do not submit USB ID's to the PCI lists :-)
